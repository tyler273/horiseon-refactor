# HORISEON REFACTOR

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor an existing website with accessibility in mind in order to be properly optimized for search engines. The application's HTML and CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to properly follow semantic structure. CSS file was properly commented for ease of reading the style sheet.

Navigation links were tested for usability and alt text for images was added for better accessability and properly optimized for search engines.
